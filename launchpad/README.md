# launchpad from deepmind

Distributed computing framework.

### Points for using launchpad
- when making a function call to a node, the parameters should only be python objects and not numpy arrays or anything else
   - though it does seem to support returning numpy arrays
   - check file `4_*.py` and `5_*.py` to understand this
